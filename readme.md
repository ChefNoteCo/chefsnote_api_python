Activate the environment
Before you work on your project, activate the corresponding environment:
$ . .venv/bin/activate

To run
$ flask --app hello run

- Serving Flask app 'hello'
- Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Don't forget to change flaskr directory to App directory this is just to follow the flask instruction

Initialize the Database File
Now that init-db has been registered with the app, it can be called using the flask command, similar to the run command from the previous page.

Note
If youâ€™re still running the server from the previous page, you can either stop the server, or run this command in a new terminal. If you use a new terminal, remember to change to your project directory and activate the env as described in Installation.

Run the init-db command:

$ flask --app flaskr init-db
Initialized the database.
There will now be a flaskr.sqlite file in the instance folder in your project.

Random Note:
http methods
Flask expects the methods argument to be a tuple, even if it only contains one method. eg @bp.route('/allrecipes', methods=('GET',))
